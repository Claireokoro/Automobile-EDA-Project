# Exploratory Data Analysis
We call the process of studying a dataset and enumerating its key properties "exploratory data analysis." This type of descriptive analytics is used. 

There are some data visualizations involved.

# About the Dataset

This data set contains information about autobiles which has 29 columns and 201 rows.

# Conclusion: Important Variables

<p>We now have a better idea of what our data looks like and which variables are important to take into account when predicting the car price. We have narrowed it down to the following variables:</p>

Continuous numerical variables:

<ul>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>Width</li>
    <li>Curb-weight</li>
    <li>Engine-size</li>
    <li>Horsepower</li>
    <li>City-mpg</li>
    <li>Highway-mpg</li>
    <li>Wheel-base</li>
    <li>Bore</li>
</ul>

Categorical variables:

<ul>
    <li>Drive-wheels</li>
</ul>

<p>As we now move into building machine learning models to automate our analysis, feeding the model with variables that meaningfully affect our target variable will improve our model's prediction performance.</p>
